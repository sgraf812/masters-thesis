abstract = {This chapter introduces the class of perfect graphs known as comparability graphs or transitively orientable graphs. An undirected graph G=(V, E) is a comparability graph if there exists an orientation (V, F) of G. The relation F is a strict partial ordering of V whose comparability relation is exactly E, and F is called a transitive orientation of G (or of E). Comparability graphs are also known as transitively orientable graphs and partially orderable graphs. Examples of several comparability graphs are presented. The chapter provides the justification for an algorithm, which assigns a transitive orientation to a comparability graph. A graph is called decomposable if it can be expressed as a nontrivial composition of some of its induced subgraphs; otherwise, it is called indecomposable.},
